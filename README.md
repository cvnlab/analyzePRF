# analyzePRF

analyzePRF is a MATLAB toolbox for fitting population receptive field (pRF) models
to fMRI data.  It is developed by Kendrick Kay (kendrick@post.harvard.edu).

The toolbox requires the MATLAB Optimization Toolbox.

Also, the code makes use of "parfor" (Matlab Parallel Computing Toolbox).
However, this is not mandatory, as you can change the "parfor" contained
in fitnonlinearmodel.m to a regular "for" loop, if you like.

To use the toolbox, add it to your MATLAB path:
  addpath(genpath('analyzePRF'));

To try the toolbox on an example dataset, change to the analyzePRF directory 
and then type:
  example1;
This script will download the example dataset (if it has not already been
downloaded) and will run the toolbox on the dataset.
